# Exploring-NYC-Public-School-Test-Result-Scores
This is my first project using Pandas to draw inferences from the SAT score results of schools in NYC.

Every year, American high school students take SATs, which are standardized tests intended to measure literacy, numeracy, and writing skills. There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a **maximum score of 800 points**. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.

Analyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. 

I used the `schools.csv` file for my analysis that I found on datacamp, which is previewed below.

I have attempted to use my learnings about pandas and pivot tables to find answers to a few questions: 
1. What schools in NYC have the best math results?
2. What are the top 10 performing schools based on the combined SAT scores?
3. Which single borough has the largest standard deviation in the combined SAT score?
